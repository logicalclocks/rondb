# Test case to verify Resource group with case and accent insensitive names.
#
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP café TYPE=USER VCPU=1-3 THREAD_PRIORITY=5;
# Resource group names are case and accent insensitive. So from the
# data-dictionary "cafe" is obtained for the following statement. Since
# MDL key comparison is case and accent sensitive, assert condition to verify
# expected lock with name "test.cafe" fails (lock is obtained on the
# test.café).
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP cafe TYPE=USER VCPU=1-3 THREAD_PRIORITY=5;
ERROR HY000: Resource Group 'cafe' exists
# Following statement is to verify operation with the upper case name.
CREATE RESOURCE GROUP CAFE TYPE=USER VCPU=1-3 THREAD_PRIORITY=5;
ERROR HY000: Resource Group 'CAFE' exists
DROP RESOURCE GROUP CaFé;
SET NAMES default;
