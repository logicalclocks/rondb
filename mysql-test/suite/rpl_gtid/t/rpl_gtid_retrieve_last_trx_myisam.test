#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test ensures that a fully retrieved transaction will not be asked to be
# retrieved again by the IO thread.
#
# The first  part of the test repeats the above procedure making the last
# transaction to be retrieved by IO thread to be a DDL (without XID or
# QUERY(COMMIT) events to mark its end).
#
# The second part of the test repeats the first part procedure by inserting
# data into a non-transactional table.
