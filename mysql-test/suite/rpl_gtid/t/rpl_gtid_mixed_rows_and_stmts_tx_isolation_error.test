# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test will generate transactions on the master mixing RBR and SBR,
# instructing the master to set the flag stating that the transactions are pure
# RBR using debug instrumentation.
#
# Since BUG#25040331 fix there is an optimization on the slave applier that
# will set the transaction isolation level to READ COMMITTED for pure row based
# transactions when the applier's transaction isolation level is more
# restrictive than that.
#
# This optimization is assuming that no QUERY (other than terminal transaction
# ones, like "COMMIT", "ROLLBACK", "XA END") can happen in the middle of a pure
# row based replicated transaction (the flag is set on the GTID event).
#
# This test will assert that the slave applier will fail when using the
# optimization and finding a non-terminal QUERY in the middle of a assumed pure
# row based replicated transaction.
