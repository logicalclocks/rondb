# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test will check if reset replica is generating correct Previous_gtids
# event in first relay log file after a RESET REPLICA.
#
# It will:
# 1) generate some workload at the master;
# 2) sync the slave with the master;
# 3) stop replica replication threads;
# 4) do RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS on the master;
# 5) do RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS on the slave;
# 6) do RESET REPLICA on the slave;
# 7) restart the slave.
#
# Slave shall be able to sync with master without issues.
