# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that we can avoid clearing writeset history when executing an empty
# transaction.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Exectute some DDLs and DMls on master.
# 2. Sync slave sql with master and filter out these DDLs and DMls on slave,
#    then they become empty transactions when applying them on slave.
# 3. Verify that last_committed is not increased, since writeset history
#    is not cleared when applying these empty transactions on slave.
