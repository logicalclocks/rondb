# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This is wrapper testcase of common/rpl/rpl_mta_rpco_acl_commands.test to verify the behavior
# of ACL commands with replica-preserve-commit-order enabled binlogless replica.
#
# === Implementation ====
#
# 1. Configure replication between source - binlogless replica.
#
# 2. Source common/rpl/rpl_mta_rpco_acl_commands.test to verify if ACL
#    commands respect replica-preserve-commit-order.
#
