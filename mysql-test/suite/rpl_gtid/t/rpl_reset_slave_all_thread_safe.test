# BUG# reset slave all is not thread-safe
#
# RESET REPLICA ALL could delete a channel, even source_pos_wait and
# wait_until_sql_thread_after_gtid were still waiting for binlog to be applied.
# It caused server crash when the functions tried to access the channel which
# had been deleted.
#
# A channel reference counter is added. It should be increased if the channel
# should not be deleted when the code is running. RESET REPLICA ALL will wait
# for no reference and then delete the channel.
