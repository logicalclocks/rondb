# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test the behavior of mysql server replication with the transaction boundary
# parser.
#
# This test will insert data in the master while the slave will have some debug
# sync points activated to stop the IO thread in the middle of the transaction
# what will cause the transactions to be spanned along distinct relay log files.
#
# As the GTID auto positioning protocol will retrieved the partial transactions
# from the beginning, we repeat the test again disabling GTID auto positioning.
#
# ==== Related Bugs and Worklogs ====

#               MISS COMPLETE TRX
