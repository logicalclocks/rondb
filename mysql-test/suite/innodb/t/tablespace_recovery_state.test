#
# This test compares tablespace file in two states :
# - When all pages were flushed to the tablespace as usual, with
# - All redos are applied after the crash recovery is completed.
# The objective of this test is to detect if the FIL_PAGE_LSN is
# correctly computed and updated during recovery.
#
# But as you may notice through Bug#35912429, the FIL_PAGE_LSN may not
# always match in the above two states of the tablespace since Innodb
# flushes non-dirtied pages S[X] latched pages too.
#
# In case of blob insert this situation happens when the lob data fits
# in the lob data pages in the multiple of commit frequency variable
# in the lob::insert() method. The current value is set 4.

# Therefore, the exact size of the blob is chosen carefully to not
# accidentally match the commit frequency variable regardless of page
# size configured. If this test fails, consider changing the value of
# c2 column or if that's too costly, simply remove this test, as
# maintaining it might be more expensive than the value it already provided.
