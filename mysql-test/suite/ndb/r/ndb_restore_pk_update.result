Stall backup completion *after* table is scanned.
... We will still collect log entries on table updates.

Run backup
Starting backup
Backup started
Update 'a' to a 'compared as equal'-value
update test.t1 set a="1A" where a="1a";
Create log entries with insert and delete as well
insert into test.t1 values("6a","6b","6c","6d");
delete from test.t1 where a="2a";
Now allow backup to complete...

Waiting for backup to complete
Backup completed
truncate t1;
Run restore
Restored table should show 'a=1a' updated to "1A"
, as well as '2a' deleted and '6a' inserted .
select * from test.t1 order by b;
a	b	c	d
1A	1b	1c	1d
3a	3b	3c	3d
6a	6b	6c	6d
drop table test.t1;
