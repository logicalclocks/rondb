# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test case verify if a server will throw the proper error when
# trying to configure it as a slave and start replica's threads when it's
# server-id is 0.
#
# The "Part One" of the test case will have a slave started with
# server_id > 0 but will be tested also after setting @@GLOBAL.server_id
# to 0.
#
# The "Part Two" of the test case will have a slave started with
# server_id = 0 but will be tested also after setting @@GLOBAL.server_id
# to a value greater than 0. In case server is configured with server_id
# equal to 0, but @@GLOBAL.server_id was set with the 'PERSIST' option,
# replica should be initialized according to the persistent variable
# value.
#
# Both parts are testing the default replication channel and a new
# replication channel in order to evaluate also the multi source slave.
