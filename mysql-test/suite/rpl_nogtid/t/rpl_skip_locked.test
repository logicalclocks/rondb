# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that INSERT ... SELECT ... SKIP LOCKED is replicated in row format when binlog_format=MIXED.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. When binlog_format=MIXED, any INSERT ... SELECT ... SKIP LOCKED statement
#     must be logged in row format.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Lock a row in a table on the source.
# Execute an INSERT ... SELECT ... SKIP LOCKED statement that reads from the table
# having a locked row.
# Verify that the replica only applied the rows that were not locked on the source.
#
# (If the statement would be replicated in statement format, the replica would
# insert also the row that was locked on the source, since that row is not locked
# on the replica).

# This test requires binlog_format=mixed
