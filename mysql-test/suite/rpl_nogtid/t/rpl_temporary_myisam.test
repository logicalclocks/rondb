# binlog. But previous tests can influence the current test's
# binlog (e.g. a temporary table in the previous test has not
# been explicitly deleted, or it has but the slave hasn't had
# enough time to catch it before STOP REPLICA, 
# and at the beginning of the current
# test the slave immediately writes DROP TEMPORARY TABLE this_old_table).
# We wait for the slave to have written all he wants to the binlog
# (otherwise RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS may come too early).

# BUG#41725: slave crashes when inserting into temporary table after
#            stop/start replica
#
#  This test checks that both reported issues (assertion failure and
#  crash) go away. It is implemented as follows:
#    
#    case 2: crash (SIGSEV)
#      i) create and insert into temporary table on master (insert
#         produces warnings)
#     ii) sync slave with master
#    iii) stop and restart replica
#     iv) insert into master more values
#      v) sync slave with master
