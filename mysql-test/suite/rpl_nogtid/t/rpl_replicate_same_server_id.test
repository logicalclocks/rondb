# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test that replicate-same-server-id works correctly in two cases:
#
#  1. If a server replicates to itself (and log-replica-updates is off)
#     then every transaction should be executed twice.
#
#  2. START REPLICA UNTIL should work correctly if replicate-same-server-id
#     is enabled and master and slave have different server_ids. This is
#     to test BUG#38934.
#
# ==== Note ====
#
# This test file was named rpl_server_id2.test prior to MySQL 5.7.5.

# Replicating in a loop like this won't work with GTIDs.
