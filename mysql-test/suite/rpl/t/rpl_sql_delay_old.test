#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test checks if the sql delay is being applied in a simple source-replica
# topology.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# The SQL_Delay is set to 5 seconds.
# For each for the six different transactions executed (two DDL, three DML and
# one multi-statement DML), the test verifies if the delay was the expected using
# replication timestamp infrastructure introduced by WL#7319.
#
# ==== References ====

# WL#7318 Delayed Replication: GTID based and relative to immediate master commit

# This test is very unstable when using windows because support for high
# precision timestamps in this platform is not as good as in unix
