#BUG#1353750 : REPLICATION FROM MASTER WITH NEW CHECKSUM ALGORITHM  
#
# ==== Purpose ====
# 
# The test check for the condition when the master uses a checksum algorithm 
# which is unknown to the slave. In such a case the master will send the 
# events with the new checksum while the slave treats it as no checksum. 
# After the fix the slave will stop if it gets a new checksum from the master
# with the error message.
#
# ====Method====
#
# For testing out the above mentioned functionality we have injected a fault  
# in the slave's code and trigger it through debug library.
# In the case we get the error message we stop the slave with the 
# error code 1593 and then restart the slave.
