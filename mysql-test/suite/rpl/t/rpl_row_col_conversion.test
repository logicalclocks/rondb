# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that Bug#22110284 has been fixed, i.e. that replication from a smaller
# type to a larger type performs the correct conversion and does not truncate
# the columns on the slave.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Set @@global.REPLICA_TYPE_CONVERSIONS to ALL_NON_LOSSY to allow conversions.
# 2. Create a table on the master, wait until it has been replicated, drop table
#    on slave and recreate with a column with greater size.
# 3. Insert values that would have be truncated on the master and wait for
#    them to be replicated.
# 4. Verify that the columns have the same length on the master and slave.
#
