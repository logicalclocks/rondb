# BUG#22305605    STOP SLAVE IO THREAD PRINTS WRONG LOST CONNECTION MESSAGE
# IN ERROR LOG FILE.

# Problem:
# STOP REPLICA IO_THREAD closes socket communication between Master and Slave.
# This prints an ERROR message in the error log
#    [ERROR] Error reading packet from server: Lost connection to MySQL server
#      during query (server_errno=2013).
# Here the socket closed intentionally by the DBA using command 'STOP REPLICA IO_THREAD'.
# Hence no need to print the message [ERROR] that says "Lost connection" which will
# confusion the users/DBAs.

# Steps to Reproduce:
# 1) Execute some dummy statements to make sure replication is working fine.
# 2) Stop I/O thread and see that there is no panic message printed in log file.
# 3) Stop SQL thread and see that there is no panic message printed in log file.
# 4) Stop both I/O and SQL threads and see that there is no panic message printed
#    in log file.
