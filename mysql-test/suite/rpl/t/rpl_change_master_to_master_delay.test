# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test will issue a CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_DELAY while both replication
# threads are stopped and there are content received by the I/O thread yet to
# be applied by the SQL thread.
#
# The test case verifies that issuing the CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE will not purge the
# relay log, and the replica will not lose master contents.
#
