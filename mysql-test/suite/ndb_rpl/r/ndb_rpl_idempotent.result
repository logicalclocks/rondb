Let's interleave some DDL and DML in the Binlog
Some DDL
create table t1(a int primary key) engine=ndb;
First epoch transaction
begin;
insert into t1 values (1), (2), (3);
commit;
Sync slave and retrieve epoch
SELECT MAX(epoch) FROM mysql.ndb_apply_status into @first_epoch;
SELECT @first_epoch;
@first_epoch
<first_epoch>
Slave contents
select * from t1 ORDER by a;
a
1
2
3
Get the next master binlog pos from the epoch
Now let's do some more DDL and DML
create table t2 (a int primary key) engine=ndb;
begin;
insert into t2 values (1), (2), (3);
commit;
