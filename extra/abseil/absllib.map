  Hide all symbols from the standard library.

  This is a workaround for libstdc++ problems which are caused
  by our INSTALL_DEBUG_TARGET cmake macro: we *link* with one .so library,
  but *run* with a different version.

  The installed mysqld-debug will not start because of:
  ./bin/mysqld-debug: symbol lookup error: ./bin/mysqld-debug:
  undefined symbol:
  _ZNSt18basic_stringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEC1Ev

  Running c++filt on that, we get
  std::basic_stringstream<char, std::char_traits<char>,
                          std::allocator<char> >::basic_stringstream()

  The abseil libraries do not come with any --version-script, and
  hence will export *all* symbols. By providing this version script
  we explicitly disable the export of everything from the standard
  library.

  For mangling of names in the standard library, see:
  https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangling
