/**
 * These functions can be used directly by blocks and other entities
 * to manage memory in an efficient manner.
 *
 * init_lc_ndbd_memory_pool
 *    Parameters:
 *      num_pools:         [IN] The number of memory pools to allocate from
 *      num_pool_threads:  [IN] The number of internal pools per long lived
 *                              pool
 *      num_split_threads: [IN] The number of internal pools per short lived
 *                              pool
 *
 *   This call is used to initialise the memory to handle the various
 *   pools that use this interface. It is called at startup before
 *   any calls to allocate memory through its interfaces have been done.
 *
 *  General malloc/free functions for NDB kernel
 *  --------------------------------------------
 *
 * lc_ndbd_pool_malloc
 *   Parameters:
 *     size:       [IN] The size of the memory to allocate in bytes
 *     pool_id:    [IN] The memory pool to use in the allocations
 *     thread_id:  [IN] The thread id that calls, used to derive the
 *                      internal pool to use
 *     clear_flag: [IN] If set clears the memory (set to 0) before returning
 *
 *   Return value:
 *     == 0     Unsuccessful allocation of memory
 *     != 0     The address of the memory allocated
 *
 *   This call allocates a memory area of exactly the requested size.
 *   It carries a pool id that identifies the global memory pool to
 *   allocate the memory from. In practice the memory will always be
 *   extended to be a multiple of 16 bytes.
 *
 * lc_ndbd_pool_free
 *   Parameters:
 *     mem:        [IN] The start of the memory area to free
 *   Return value:
 *     None         The call will crash the data node if unsuccessful
 *
 *  This call returns the memory area to the pool where it was acquired
 *  from.
 *
 *  Specialized malloc/free functions for very short-lived memory segments
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * lc_ndbd_split_malloc
 *   Parameters:
 *     mem:        [IN] The start of the memory area to split
 *     size:       [IN] The size of the memory area that should be kept at
 *                      the start address.
 *     pool_id:    [IN] The memory pool to use in the allocations
 *     thread_id:  [IN] The thread id that calls, used to derive the
 *                      internal pool to use
 *   Return value:
 *     == 0     Unsuccessful split of memory
 *     != 0     The address of the new memory split off
 *
 *   This call is used to allocate a memory region that will only be allocated
 *   for a very short time. This means that we will allocate consecutive
 *   memory and ignore bad effects from memory kept for a long time.
 *
 * lc_ndbd_split_free
 *   Parameters:
 *     mem:        [IN] The start of the split memory area to free
 *   Return value:
 *     None         The call will crash the data node if unsuccessful
 *
 *  This call returns the memory area to the pool where it was acquired
 *  from. But it waits for the entire area to be released before this
 *  can occur. Thus it is imperative that users of this interface do not
 *  hold onto memory for any longer periods.
 *
 * The above provides the details guaranteed by the API. The implementation
 * of those calls can vary dependent on which pool_id that is used.
 * There are very different use scenarios for different pools. E.g. the
 * SchemaMemory contains objects that are kept for a very long time and
 * that are only allocated and freed when a new metadata object is
 * created, altered or droppped. At the other extreme we have memory areas
 * used by signals to carry the signal payload. These are extremely short
 * lived and uses very frequent allocations and frees of fairly small
 * memory areas.

/**
 * The interface to
 * - lc_ndbd_split_malloc
 * - lc_ndbd_split_free
 * is a bit different.
 *
 * The user of this interface will start by declaring a void* variable
 * which is assigned nullptr. This variable is sent into lc_ndbd_split_malloc
 * by reference, thus lc_ndbd_split_malloc will update with a reference to
 * a memory area from where to allocate the next memory area. If the
 * method lc_ndbd_split_malloc finds that this memory area is exhausted it
 * will allocate a new area and update the referenced memory area pointer.
 *
 * The method lc_ndbd_split_malloc needs the pool_id variable to allocate new
 * memory areas when needed. The thread_id is required to use the correct
 * memory area instances when allocating new memory.
 *
 * The memory area returned by lc_ndbd_split_malloc can be returned by any
 * thread using lc_ndbd_split_free. However the interface requires those
 * memory allocations to be short-lived memory allocations since the entire
 * memory area is kept allocated until all parts have been returned.
 *
 * There is no call to return a memory area, it is expected that a thread
 * that uses this interface runs until the program is stopped and it is
 * up to higher levels in the software stack to ensure that any memory
 * allocated is returned to the OS.
 *
 * When all memory areas returned from lc_ndbd_split_malloc using one
 * void* pointer has called lc_ndbd_split_free, then it will be
 * discovered that the entire area is free'd and the area will be
 * available for a new lc_ndbd_split_malloc calls.
 *
 * It is vital that memory allocated in this interface is never held
 * onto for any extended periods of time. The normal use is to allocate
 * memory in one thread receiving messages, store the message in this
 * memory and send the message to its destination. The memory is free'd
 * as soon as the message have been handled.

/**
 * We will maintain a set of memory pools for each memory region, e.g.
 * Schema memory is one such region, Transaction Memory is another such
 * region. The purpose of the sets is to avoid mutex contention when
 * allocating memory.
 *
 * The ordinary malloc pools are used by all block threads and the number
 * of pools should be based on the number of block threads. The number
 * of split threads is mainly to ensure that the receive threads in
 * the data node can allocate without contention with other receive
 * threads.
 *
 * Some of those pools will not be used, this isn't a problem since
 * they will not allocate any substantial amount of memory, only a
 * few bytes for control structures. Thus we optimise on simple
 * mappings from memory region and thread id to pool.
 *
 * Each pool that is actually used will use at least 2 MByte of
 * memory which is the amount of memory we allocate from the
 * global memory pool each time we run out of memory in the pool.
