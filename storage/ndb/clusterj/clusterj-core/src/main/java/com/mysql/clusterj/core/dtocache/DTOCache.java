    /**
     * The DTOCache maintains a cache of DynamicObject's.
     *
     * DynamicObject's can be of several types. When requesting a new object one must
     * return an object of the same type. To ensure this we maintain a list of
     * cached objects of a certain type. This list is maintained by the class
     * CacheEntry. To find the correct list to fetch from we have a HashMap to find
     * the proper CacheEntry object. This map is called cacheEntryMap.
     *
     * In addition we need to maintain a global order of which objects that have
     * been cached for the longest duration. This is maintained as a global list of
     * CacheObjects. This list is maintained by the methods removeGlobal,
     * removeLastGlobal, insertGlobal. When we remove an object from the cache for
     * use we need to use removeGlobal to remove it. When we put it back in the
     * cache we use insertGlobal. When we need an old entry to remove we use the
     * removeLastGlobal method.
     *
     * We also need a method to discover if someone is trying to release an object
     * for a second time. If one calls session.release twice on the same object,
     * the second call should throw an error. However for this we need to have
     * a quick check that the object isn't cached. If an object is cached it cannot
     * be released again. Only the cache is now able to release the object.
     *
     * When the application drops a table, alters a table with copy algorithm or
     * truncate the table, in all those cases the table is dropped and possibly
     * a new one is created. The application will discover this through errors
     * when trying to use the table. In this case the application should call
     * unloadSchema to remove all objects of this table. Since a table isn't
     * necessarily mapped to only one class we actually drop the entire
     * cache in those situations. This is handled by the drop call.
     *
     * However when we drop we could still have elements that are maintained by
     * the cache that was in use when the drop call was made. When those elements
     * are released we need to ensure that those elements are not put back in the
     * cache, those objects must be properly released.
     *
     * In order to handle this we put objects that are currently in use into a
     * HashMap called inUseMap. When a drop call is made we will traverse this
     * list and ensure that all objects in use are marked as invalid to ensure
     * they are removed when they are released.
     *
     * Thus cached objects are always to be found in 3 places, the global list
     * of cached objects, the local list of cached objects of a certain type
     * (maintained by CacheEntry) and finally in the inCacheMap.
     *
     * Objects that are currently in use is found in the inUseMap and in no
     * other place.
     *
     * In addition we have a list of free CacheObjects that is maintained in
     * the unusedCacheObjects object (this is a CacheEntry object). This list
     * should normally be empty if enough objects are used in the cache. But
     * it will be full after creation, after a drop and after releasing
     * objects that require release.
     *
     * The public interface to DTOCache is that "get()" is called to retrieve
     * an object from the cache.
     *
     * The "put" method is used to put an object back into the cache when the
     * application called releaseCache.
     *
     * The "remove" method is called right before releasing an object when the
     * normal release method is called. This release method is sometimes
     * called from this DTOCache object and thus it knows which SessionImpl
     * object it is part of.
     *
     * Finally the "insert" method is called when a new object is created that
     * should be handled by the cache.
     *
     * The cache doesn't currently handle all variants of DynamicObjects. Thus
     * an object that is present neither in inUseMap nor in inCacheMap is
     * not maintained by the cache and will always be immediately released.
     *
     * There is also two "drop" calls to remove cached objects of a certain
     * type from the cache.
     *
     * The cache will at most contain a maximum number of objects. This
     * includes both objects that are cached and objects that are in use.
     * We can temporarily increase the size of the number of objects to
     * to ensure that this doesn't limit the number of objects that can be
     * in use in parallel. Those objects will be released again when the
     * release calls are made.
